						<h2>About Isaac Newton.</h2>
						<p>Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author who is widely known as one of the most 
						inspiring scientists of all time, and a key figure in the scientific revolution.
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac Newton was born in January 4, 1643 and died in March 31, 1727. He developed the principles of modern physics, including the laws of motion. He is credited as one of the greatest minds of the 17th century's Scientific Revolution.
						In his book 'Principia', it contains information on nearly all concepts of physics except energy, ultimately helping him to explain the laws of motion and the theory of gravity.
						It also contains his method of infinitesmal calculus, which were the foundations for his theory of light and color. Also including the laws of planetary motion,
						it eventually led to the publication of his physics book 'Principia' and his theory of gravity.
						<br/>
						<br/>Overall, Newton was one of the foundations of modern physics our world now uses. Having 'Principia' being published, it helped
						us understand more on understanding motion and gravity and how it works, what it does and why it is important.</p>

						<h4>Gravity</h4>
						<p>Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all objects with mass or energy - including stars, planets, whole bodies of galaxies, and even light - are brought toward one another.</p>

						<h4>Calculus</h4>
						<p>Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits.</p>

						<h3>Limerick</h3>
						<p>
							Isaac Newton, admirable thinker
							<br/>Who under the tree sat down to tinker
							<br/>This led to his discovery,
							<br/>Of a law that is gravity,
							<br/>Due to an apple that fell on his hair
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-4">
						<h3>Acrostic Poem</h3>
						<p>
						Isaac Newton was influential
						<br/>Science and Math changed through his name
						<br/>As gravity and calculus made the
						<br/>Apparatus of modern physics
						<br/>Continuous change as well!
						<br/>
						<br/>Newtons for measure of force
						<br/>Explained the refraction of light
						<br/>Telescopes using reflecting mirrors
						<br/>Oh, and also the cat door
						<br/>Newtonian Apocalypse, based off the Bible!

						<h3>Who Am I Poem</h3>
						<p>
							Born in Woolsthorpe, United Kingdom
							<br/>Mathematician, Physicist and Astronomer his axiom
							<br/>
							<br/>Laws of gravity,
							<br/>The complex of calculus,
							<br/>Refraction of light,
							<br/>All discovered or invented by him!
							<br/>
							<br/>Wrote the Principia,
							<br/>Contained futuristic knowledge,
							<br/>Even about elliptical orbits.
							<br/>He was a polymath, before Leo!
							<br/>
							<br/>Known for his foundations of science and vast knowledge,
							<br/>Who could this man be?
