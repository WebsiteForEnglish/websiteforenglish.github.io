						<h2>About Isaac Newton.</h2>
						<p>Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author who is widely known as one of the most 
						inspiring scientists of all time, and a key figure in the scientific revolution.
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac Newton was born in January 4, 1643 and died in March 31, 1727. He developed the principles of modern physics, including the laws of motion. He is credited as one of the greatest minds of the 17th century's Scientific Revolution.
						In his book 'Principia', it contains information on nearly all concepts of physics except energy, ultimately helping him to explain the laws of motion and the theory of gravity.
						It also contains his method of infinitesmal calculus, which were the foundations for his theory of light and color. Also including the laws of planetary motion,
						it eventually led to the publication of his physics book 'Principia' and his theory of gravity.
						<br/>
						<br/>Overall, Newton was one of the foundations of modern physics our world now uses. Having 'Principia' being published, it helped
						us understand more on understanding motion and gravity and how it works, what it does and why it is important.</p>

						<h4>Gravity</h4>
						<p>Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all objects with mass or energy - including stars, planets, whole bodies of galaxies, and even light - are brought toward one another.</p>

						<br/>Continuous change as well!
						<br/>
						<br/>Newtons for measure of force
						<br/>Explained the refraction of light

							<br/>Thought about gravity, change in variables and the refraction of light
							<br/>Hated to socialize, did not marry and made anecdotes to make him seem like a nice person
							<br/>Feared criticism against his work, thinking people would assume it’s just a farce
							<br/>Wrote the laws of gravitation and invented calculus for continuous change

					<h3><b>Exclusive Interview with Isaac Newton</b></h3>
					<h4><b>March 24, 2019. New York, TV30 Studio</b></h4>
					<p> Justin: Before we begin, I would like to thank Isaac Newton for joining us today. We appreciate you using your time for our interview.
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: Salutations everyone. I’m the man behind gravity - Newton!
						<br/>
						<br/>Justin: So, how are you? Anything going on right now?
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: I’m doing fine, thank you. As of now, nothing’s really going on at the moment
						<br/>
						<br/>Justin:  Did the apple really fall onto your head which made you question about gravity? What actually drive you to think about why things fall?
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: Actually, no. The apple didn’t fall from the tree. It was all actually just an anecdote of mines to make myself look like a nicer person. In fact, I actually hate socializing with people. I prefer silence than the noise of human speech. In fact, II’m just here because I’m being paid. What actually made me question about gravity is that I just kept on contemplating about the universe, thinking about why we exist, why stars exist, and so on. It sounds bland, cliched, depressing and uninteresting, but it’s how it happened.
						<br/>
						<br/>Justin: Did that also lead you to invent calculus? Why did you invent calculus?
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: Yes. I invented calculus to exactly explain how the laws of motion and gravitation worked. It was maths for showing and calculating continuous change, which was why it was known as the ‘study of change’.Gottfried Leibniz also actually invented calculus independent from mines, too. I guess you could say we both contributed to the development of calculus.
						<br/>
						<br/>Justin: Ah, I see. People also mentioned about your experiments with prisms and light. What is that about?
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: Oh, yes. The prism experiment. To put it into perspective, an Italian philosopher Francesco Grimaldi published a work on diffraction, which means a beam of light going through a prism which forms a rainbow. Being the skeptical me, I went and bought my own prism, and started experimenting on it. From then on I proved Francesco about his theory on diffraction.
						<br/>
						<br/>Justin: Alright, were there any problems in writing your theories and such?
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: Well, yes. I had a pretty rough childhood which led me to go into a lot of mental breakdowns, and had a very severe nervous disorder in 1695. My mom died in 1679, which was the general reason on why I didn’t like socializing with people. I shut myself off from the world to continue my research on alchemy. I also had a very uneducated father, and when my mom remarried my step-father was absolutely abysmal.
						<br/>
						<br/>Justin: Were you still able to contribute to science and mathematics, though?
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: Yes, I believe. Inventing calculus allowed people to calculate motion of planets, and draw curves and tangents and still be able to solve them. Gravity’s three laws helped to explain why things “fall” into the ground, which were the very basic foundation of physics. Calculus and physics have been used in many professions in present day.
						<br/>
						<br/>Justin: I would like to ask you some more questions, but I’m afraid this is all the time we have left. Thank you for your time at TV30 Studio.
						<br/>
						<br/>Isaac: You’re welcome. Have a good evening.
